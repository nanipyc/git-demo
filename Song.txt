Always seems to me
You only see what people want you to see
How long's it gonna be
Before we get on the bus and cause no fuss?
Get a grip on yourself it don't cost much

Free to be whatever you
Whatever you say if it comes my way, it's alright
You're free to be wherever you
Wherever you please you can shoot the breeze if you want
