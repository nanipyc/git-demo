I'm free to be whatever I
Whatever I choose and I'll sing the blues if I want
I'm free to say whatever I
Whatever I like if it's wrong or right, it's alright

Free to be whatever you
Whatever you say if it comes my way, it's alright
You're free to be wherever you
Wherever you please you can shoot the breeze if you want
