I'm free to be whatever I choose
I'm learning to live, losing the blues
I'm trying to be a real cool dude
I'm doing the best that I can do.

I say love me, hold me
Love me, hold me

Always seems to me
You only see what people want you to see
How long's it gonna be
Before we get on the bus and cause no fuss?
Get a grip on yourself it don't cost much
